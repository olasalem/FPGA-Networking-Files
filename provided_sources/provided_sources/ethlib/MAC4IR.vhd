--This is the snippet code of the entity that student should provide.
--IMPORTANT Modification from previous years:
--0)Interface with the real nexys3 ethernet PHY is provided to fit this entity
--1)Clock is 25Mhz --> student should divide clock by 2 and not by 8 when retrieving data
--2)Signal RXVALID and TXVALID have been added
--3)CRC core has been provided to compute FCS at reception and transmission
--4)Signal to manage collision have been added (carrier and collision)
--6)Hello_eth.vhd entity has been provided to explain the use of the new PHY interface
-- and the use of crc_core it sends udp packet in broadcast mode.
--7)Basic software has been provided to receive udp packet from the board on 
-- a real pc without root privileges.
